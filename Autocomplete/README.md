Worst-case Scenario:
searchWords_slow is much much slower than searchWords_fast

I have found a few instances where searchWords_slow can be faster. When the search string is at or near the beginning of the list it doesn't have to iterate that much.

I believe average case, searchWords_fast is superior.

More testing!
